# CHatField for RStudio

CHatField for RStudio provides an interactive interface to ChatGPT within RStudio. It allows users to easily consult ChatGPT for a variety of tasks, such as code explanations, code completion, optimization, and refactoring. The package is designed to make it simple for users to receive code suggestions and implement them directly in their R scripts.

Key features of CHatField include:

-   A user-friendly UI with a conversation log to track interactions with ChatGPT.

-   Options to execute various actions, such as commenting on selected code, generating unit tests, and creating variable names.

-   The ability to add context to user queries for more accurate responses from ChatGPT.

-   Optional on-the-fly code replacement that inserts ChatGPT's suggestions directly into the R script.

-   Seamless integration with RStudio's API for a smooth user experience.
